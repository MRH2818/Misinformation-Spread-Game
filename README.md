# ðŸ“° Misinformation Spread Game

This game is designed to test the continued influence effect: even after misinformation is corrected, the original message can still shape beliefs and memory. By repeatedly introducing corrections that subvert the gist of a story, the game demonstrates how difficult it is to fully erase the impact of initial information.

- Single-player browser game about how news stories change as they are retold and corrected
- Each round, you read a political story and retell it from memory
- After each retelling, a new "correction" is introduced that subverts the previous message
- The process repeats, showing how the story's meaning can shift with each correction
- Highlights how original misinformation can continue to influence thinking, even after many corrections
